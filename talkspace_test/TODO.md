#  TODO

### Create / Edit drawing

* The user should be able to change the brush’s stroke width.
* “Record” the drawing and “Replay” it at will
    * When creating a drawing, record the drawing through time and allow other users (in the list and/or the drawing page) to “play” the drawing. The result should be as if a user remotely sees the creator creating the drawing themselves.

# DONE

* local database of drawings
* Thumbnail of the drawing itself.
* There should be a special “Eraser” brush.
* The user should be able to choose colors (at least five).
* allow a user to delete their drawings
* Creation date & time.
* Time it took to draw (from first stroke to sending the drawing).
